<small>_This document represents Mad Ball's notes from their session at the fall 2019 Shuttleworth Foundation gathering – a collection of people with lots of experience with projects like this, in a variety of fields. It may be updated based on feedback! An editable version is here: [https://pad.riseup.net/p/adhoc-governance-tips-keep](https://pad.riseup.net/p/adhoc-governance-tips-keep)_</small>

These are tips for growing governance in projects that start spontaneously, with one or a few people. This format is particularly common in grassroots, decentralized, bottom-up activities. Don't overkill governance! Typically it's most efficient to operate with minimal governance and add governance "ad hoc" – that is, as needed.

## Some metas.

* **Be explicit about a need for decision.** If you realize a decision or governance issue should be addressed, note that explicitly.
* **Decide how to decide.** Decide who gets to decide, and decide how you reach decision (consensus? vote?)
* **Deciding vs. input vs. being informed.** Don't give someone an impression they're making a decision when you just want input.
* **Don't make a rule you won't follow yourself.**
* **Don't assume people have the same expectations.**

## Critical moments.

You don't need governance until you do. Here's critical moments in a project's lifespan to watch out for. You may find yourself making decisions immediately before an expected landmark. In other cases you're in the midst of it: don't avoid decisions, recognize the lack of governance, make it when you can. Don't overreact to create unnecessary governance.

* **First content/product.** First time something exists that can be "owned", including licensing and web domains.
* **First new person joins.** A new person not in the 'inner circle'.
* **First disagreement.** (See decision making tips below!)
* **First public event/celebration.** Communications and messaging.
* **First public recognition.** How to talk to others about the project.
* **First fundraising.**
* **First funding.**
* **First hire.** Policies need to be in place.
* **First F#@&-up.**

## Tips.

### Meeting tips

* **Regularly scheduled meetings!** This is really important for *all* stages of a project.
* **There should always be something to say.** If not, why?
* **Assign a chair** to keep things on track.
* **Take notes** and share these the next meeting.
  * Have one document or link to find all meeting notes.

### Decision making tips

* **"Not deciding" is a decision.** And not all decisions can be postponed.
  * **Don't wait to make sure things are perfect.**
* **Don't be imitative.** Don't default to norms: check decisions against your values.
* **Attempt consensus, vote otherwise.** Voting is contentious.
  * Check out **[Gradients of Agreement](https://www.trg-inc.com/resources/team-decision-making-the-gradients-of-agreement/)** for consensus decisions.
* **Recognize when you need to part ways.**

### Communication tips

* **Recognize and communicate decisions.** Be clear a decision happened and communicate it in writing (esp. to relevant people)
* **Transparency** in process and communications builds trust, and invites serendipity.
* **Don't broadcast too much** or people can't tell which things matter.
  * **Introduce people to each other** to encourage information flow in natural networks (rather than relying on broadcasting)

### Funding tips

* **What are you funding** for-profit? non-profit? who controls what?
* **Be transparent about funding sources** when possible or appropriate.
* **Decide who gets the funding to spend on for what.**
* **Public discussion of decisions.**
* **Centralized planning for fundraising.**

### Assigning work

* **Roles, responsibilities, scope of work** agree on these, and explicitly in contracts.
* **Don't delegate and then do yourself.**
* **Don't delegate and run.** Be sure to check-in.
