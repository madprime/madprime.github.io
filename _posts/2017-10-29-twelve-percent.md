<small style="color:#aaa">_This post discusses something unrelated to my
current professional work &ndash; but another, ongoing personal commitment to a better world. &mdash; Madeleine_</small>

**Today Chris and I celebrate twelve years of marriage.**

**Today we commit to giving 12% of our pre-tax income this year to charity.**

I write about this because I hope it inspires someone &ndash; to stretch, to
give more back to the world, and to give deliberately. I've written about this
before, and I know the topic is discomforting! But there is much good that can
be done. So I share anyway, in the hopes that somewhere out there, someone is
swayed.

Our tradition is a ratchet. Last year we gave 11%, and 10% the year before.
It may feel like a lot now, but we got here with a steady pace. We started many
years ago, at 4%. Where it ends, we don't yet know &ndash; but we can say this
much: it continues.

## We give because it gives us purpose. ##

Our annual act recognizes our fortune: in family, in friends, in health, and in
wealth. And in our continued partnership, and our growth together &ndash; over
these years &ndash; to become better people than we would have been alone.

And in a global sense, we are so enormously fortunate.

Giving yields dividends of purpose. As a celebration it may seem a bit sober.
But it has substance. In our darker moments it gives us something to remember:
that we have been able to do some good.

I hope others can be inspired to celebrate similarly. Accidental privilege is
an unchosen responsibility, but also, I think, an opportunity.

## We give because it matters. ##

There's no purpose to wasted money. In past years the work of others &ndash;
most notably that of [GiveWell](https://www.givewell.org/) &ndash; has dug hard
into the evidence for giving. That work gives us the trust that now, more than
ever, charity is an act that creates real good.

We each select where our half goes. This year, I'll give almost all my portion
to GiveWell itself, to grant to top charities at its discretion. In recent
years I've followed their recommendations; this time around I'm happy to
trust them directly, and grant them the efficiency of discretion. The funding
Is most likely to go to the [Against Malaria
Foundation](https://www.givewell.org/charities/against-malaria-foundation)
(AMF), GiveWell's current top recommendation, which [they
estimate](https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/our-criteria/cost-effectiveness/cost-effectiveness-models)
as having an efficiency of roughly $5,500 per death averted.

Chris will give 65% of his half to
[GiveDirectly](https://www.givewell.org/charities/give-directly) &ndash;
unconditional cash transfers to the extreme poor &ndash; and the rest to
GiveWell’s discretionary fund. He’s a big fan of GiveDirectly’s approach to
experimentation, helping establish a baseline to which other interventions can
be compared. Although GiveWell's analysis estimates this is a quarter as
efficient as AMF, there's something satisfying about the act of income
redistribution embodied in a direct cash transfer from one human to another.

If you know me already, you might wonder how our acts of giving contrast to my
professional work. I am Executive Director of a nonprofit with its own vision
for a better world &ndash; Open Humans Foundation. I don't see these as
inconsistent. GiveWell represents the "safe" investment &ndash; like an index
fund. And my profession is a single bet which could yield enormous value.
Besides, Open Humans is a complement of sorts: the donation of data, rather
than money.

## We give because we can. ##

Not everyone has the capacity to give. But you might be more capable than you
know &ndash; or you might have more to give, some day in the future.

There are times we wonder if we've gone too far now, by stretching beyond "tithing
to the world". But how much is "too much"? In Jewish tradition, giving away
more than a fifth of income is considered irresponsible. But we are far from that.

There are also times we’re convinced we still fall too short. Our savings grow,
I know that we could afford to give more. And these are the times I remind
myself: next year we can face this challenge anew. To stretch ourselves
a little farther, and strive to ever give more.
