Earlier this afternoon, I submitted an application for Open Humans to be an
"engagement partner" for the All of Us Research Program.

**You can read the proposal here: [20170324-aou-proposal.pdf]({{ site.url }}/files/20170324-aou-proposal.pdf)**

*The call for application: ["All of Us Research Program Engagement Partners (OT2)"](https://www.nih.gov/research-training/allofus-research-program/funding/all-us-research-program-engagement-partners-ot2)*

I'm sharing the proposal publicly because I think it will be of interest
to many community members &ndash; and because it's not an idea I expect any
could steal. Open Humans members are something unique and powerful.

The <a href="https://www.nih.gov/research-training/allofus-research-program">All
of Us Research Program</a> &ndash; initially called the "Precision Medicine
Initiative" &ndash; is an expansive effort of the United States National
Institutes of Health (NIH) to advance health through unique, personal data
associated with individuals. In the words of the NIH, it_"will be a
participant-engaged, data-driven enterprise supporting research at the
intersection of lifestyle, environment, and genetics to produce new knowledge
with the goal of developing more effective ways to prolong health and treat
disease."_

This clearly resonates with many goals of Open Humans. Indeed, several
community members have asked whether we're involved!

I hope we can be.
