Today is my first formal day as a [Shuttleworth Fellow](https://shuttleworthfoundation.org/fellows/),
pursuing my vision to promote a new, open approach for human health data and
research.

## My vision

I want to apply open principles to how we approach health research.

This is not your standard flavor of "open science". I believe in an open
approach that harkens to the ethos of the open source movement: empowering and
involving all individuals, participant as well as researcher. In so doing,
we unlock new approaches and opportunities for research.

I believe achieving change requires a combination of technology,
community, and thoughtful design. [Open Humans](https://www.openhumans.org)
combines these: it is a project, platform, and community that makes the
hypothetical real -- through this, we discover what works and what
does not.

While Open Humans acts as direct instrument of achieving new forms of
"open", it can also act as a demonstration of how this new approach has substantial
value for society and science. I hope it serves as a beacon to influence
the policies and practices of others, and a cornerstone of a broader community
advocating for new, open approaches to health research.

## About the fellowship

The Shuttleworth Fellowship is unique. It funds me -- but it also funds more:
through their co-investment approach, I am now empowered to act as a
potential funder. It is flexible and ongoing: what money I invest, and how I do
so, is something I'll explore in the coming year.

Although today is "day one", I've been welcomed in the past weeks
and connected to the fellow community via chat and email.
Every fellow is brilliant and innovative, applying their vision for openness
to new fields. In particular, I invite you to learn more about the other three
new fellows:

* [Alasdair Davies](https://shuttleworthfoundation.org/fellows/alasdair-davies/): Building affordable conservation technology
* [Anasuya Sangupta](https://shuttleworthfoundation.org/fellows/anasuya-sengupta/): Expanding human history online
* [Tarek Loubani](https://shuttleworthfoundation.org/fellows/tarek-loubani/): Making open medical hardware

## About this blog

One of my duties as a fellow will be to blog regularly, to write about my
vision and share it with others. That vision is closely related to
[Open Humans](https://www.openhumans.org), a project I've co-founded.
While there is an [Open Humans blog](https://blog.openhumans.org), that
venue is for our Open Humans newsletters. I need a place to share my more
personal vision.

And so I've created this blog. It's open source, adapting [an existing work](https://github.com/sharu725/vyaasa),
shared in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/madprime/madprime.github.io)
and deployed using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).
