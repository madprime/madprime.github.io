"Open Sourcing Ourselves" is a keynote talk I gave
at the 2017 Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC)
on August 22. The talk reflects on a bit of my own history,
my experiences with the Personal Genome Project, my vision
for Open Humans, and how we &ndash; as humans &ndash; can
open source ourselves.

The talk is 39 minutes in length, and a written transcript
of it is below.

<hr style="margin: 20px 0px;">

Thank you. I'm honored and thrilled to have a chance to speak with you today,
and to tell you about my vision for how we can open source ourselves. In
addition to my current work on Open Humans, I was previously Director of
Research at the Personal Genome Project.

So&hellip; I thought I’d get started on how I got here, and got interested
in sharing.

<img style="float:right; max-width: 400px; width:50%; margin-left: 10px;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/bosc2017-slide-3.png">
It all started with me discovering something wrong on the Internet.

I needed a picture of DNA for a slide during my lab meeting presentation, and
it was only later that I discovered that this picture – which I took from the
DNA Wikipedia page &ndash; is wrong. That’s not how hydrogen bonds work! The
oxygen does not bond to oxygen, and there’s a missing oxygen in the ribose.
These are the parts that are wrong.  So I had to fix that.

<img style="float:right; max-width: 400px; width:50%; margin-left: 10px;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/bosc2017-slide-4.png">
I created a new version of that picture to go on to the DNA page. And I
took it from there. It turns out that replication forks are kind of easy to
mess up, so that one was fixed. There’s the Griffith’s Experiment, the history
of genetics. And in the top right is a picture of some PCR tubes. That's my
hand at the top of the PCR page. That’s immortality.

<img style="float:right; max-width: 400px; width:50%; margin-left: 10px;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/bosc2017-slide-5.png">
I also had the opportunity to do some stuff that felt really meaningful. I
worked with One Laptop Per Child to put together a bunch of articles for an
offline Wikipedia that was then used by hundreds of thousands of children in
Peru and Uruguay. And this is a screencap from a YouTube video on this. And
sometimes it feels wonderful to be able to empower people, by giving them
things, simple things like knowledge that we take for granted.

<img style="float:right; max-width: 400px; width:50%; margin-left: 10px;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/bosc2017-slide-6.png">
Importantly, I also added no less than three pictures of cats to Wikipedia
pages. The middle one is one of my favorite demonstrations of mutations, it's
a temperature-sensitive mutation. I also brought the Genetics article to
Featured Article status.

And I learned that sharing feels good.  In the top right there’s a
“barnstar”, that’s the way that Wikipedians reward each other for good
work. I got a physical one from my friend Kat Walsh, who was really into
Wikipedia at the time. She’s actually now one of the board members of the
Free Software Foundation. It all connects.

I also come away from my work with Wikipedia with this sense that open
systems can win, and Wikipedia is this open system for sharing knowledge
that was previously in closed encyclopedias.

In the meantime, I was being a graduate student. I was doing biotech
development in George Church’s lab. I was developing a method for doing
cytosine methylation profiling using methylation-sensitive restriction
enzymes &ndash; these pictures are not here to teach you anything &ndash;
it’s just proof that I was at the bench, and then I took that data &ndash;
I actually worked with some of the early sequencing machines, and then
gave up and used Illumina &ndash; and did programming, used software,
used Python to analyze the data and create graphics and what-not.

As I wrapped up that work, I discovered something else in the lab that
caught my attention &ndash; that was about sharing.  And that was George’s
vision for a sort of radical sense of sharing, called the Personal Genome
Project.

<img style="float:right; max-width: 400px; width:50%; margin-left: 10px;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/bosc2017-slide-9.png">
George’s vision was grand. It was big. He wanted to open source our genomes,
make them public domain, in combination with extensive phenotype data. And
here I’ve taken a quote from his original proposal: “full medical records”,
“craniofacial MRI”. He wanted the data that was potentially identifiable, and
in full public data release. He wanted people to enter into this, with the
exposure of themselves, agreeing to the potential of re-identification. Or
potentially simply identifying themselves, and donating all of this
information into the public good.

So this is a sort of literal sense of “open sourcing ourselves”.

There’s actually Personal Genome Projects in other places, in the UK, and
Austria, and Canada &ndash; and one of the UK PGP folks is here. But at the
pilot site at Harvard, with George Church, I was the Director of Research
for several years, and I was a de facto project manager. I was working in
every aspect of the project, from soup to nuts: from collecting the samples
to analyzing the output data and talking to participants.

In the end, in its current state this project has produced 351 participant
genomes, and there’s over 1900 phenotype surveys &ndash; traits &ndash; and I
would say this is not a super impressive amount of data compared to the vast
amount of data that is being produced and shared and you’re all working with.
So I’m not going to claim that there’s a particularly impactful amount of data
in that, but the PGP’s biggest impact was probably the ELSI stuff: the
Ethical, Legal and Societal Implications. Because it was really pushing
boundaries on what we considered was shareable, and what are the risks
participants can agree to take, when they choose to share. It’s impressive
that the IRB agreed to let the study proceed &ndash; there are IRBs that I’ve
since engaged with that are far more conservative.

So I’m going to give you some of my takeaway lessons from working with the
Personal Genome Project.

<img style="float:right; max-width: 400px; width:50%; margin-left: 10px;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/bosc2017-slide-12.png">
One is engaging participants and sharing with them.

The Personal Genome Project was a highly engaged project, as we were producing
this data, which is unusual &ndash; most projects will take a sample and then
maybe get back to you much later, but there was an ongoing relationship formed
with these participants and they talked to us about a lot of things. This is
a picture from our GET Conference, which Jason Bobe, in the foreground,
organized &ndash; he’s the former Executive Director of the organization that
I now lead. And that’s one of our outstanding participants, James Turner, his
name may come up again later, he’s just a great contributor to the community
in addition to sharing his data.

One of the things we did as part of this engagement was returning data. Almost
nobody does this: almost nobody did this, and almost nobody does this right now.
Most of the genomes we are producing are not shared with the individuals they
come from. As researchers, I think we might look to what the commercial
companies are doing &ndash; where it’s easy to download your genetic data &ndash;
and ask ourselves the hard question of whether we are performing data sharing
with the participants that it came from. We talk a lot about sharing the data
with each other.

<img style="float:right; max-width: 400px; width:50%; margin-left: 10px;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/bosc2017-slide-14.png">
When we returned the genome data, we also had to do reports. This is part of
trying to give people insight into what it is they’re trying to share. And the
truth is that we don’t really understand everything in the genome, so we just
tried our best and told them it was a preliminary report, but hopefully
they’re okay to go ahead from there. I want to make a note &ndash; I think this
is conflated a lot in conversations about returning genomes &ndash; I don’t think
most groups returning data need to engage in this. It was a special activity
for the Personal Genome Project because the ask for public data release sort
of brought the obligation to help people try to understand the data. The act
of interpretation is far more burdensome than the raw data alone, and it
brings you close to that position of being a clinician and explaining things
to people, that researchers should not have to be in.

<img style="float:right; max-width: 400px; width:50%; margin-left: 10px;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/bosc2017-slide-17.png">
I found myself answering lots of questions: a lot of the questions were about
how to donate data or give samples. They wanted to be involved in the project.
Not so many were concerned about the data that they received, which is a
relief, because I think a lot of our fears around engaging the participants
are if they’re going to keep asking us questions. There was meeting each other
at these GET Conferences, where we got a lot of time to meet the participants
themselves. And finally &ndash; and kind of radically &ndash; participants
were able to talk to each other. Think about a classic research study where
someone comes in and you get the sample and then they’re gone. They’re not
talking to each other as participants! They don’t have that ability to
complain about you by talking to each other. Ceding that power to the
participant is, I think, a scary act but a wonderful act. It acknowledges
them as co-creators in the project of science.

That’s a forum that James Turner, a participant, put together. A participant
put together this forum so that participants could talk to each other.

<img style="float:right; max-width: 400px; width:50%; margin-left: 10px;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/bosc2017-slide-18.png">
So, to wrap that section up a bit, here's some participant engagement tips.
I'm guessing none of you engage participants&hellip; but if you ever consider
it&hellip; here's my tips.

Help a bit, but then point them to other resources. And set expectations.
The temptation of someone who's never done this is to get sucked into the
explaining, to give them so much support, because you have so much knowledge.
You just want to give it all to them.

Develop standard responses, so you're not like typing out a new response each
time, but you just kind of have a standard one that works for a lot of things.

But, you know, for all those limitations you should always be extremely
thankful. Wrap up with a thank you, start with a thank you. Because your
research would not exist without them. And often participation in research
is a lot more work than you think it is, when you're receiving their samples
or their data. Participants can go to a lot of effort just to be part of the
study.

<img style="float:right; max-width: 400px; width:50%; margin-left: 10px;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/bosc2017-slide-19.png">
The second topic is to bring the elephant into the room, and to talk about scary
data. And this is probably the most interesting topic for people here, because
we worry about privacy when we talk about data from humans. Genome data and
other omics data. And yet there are individuals who still choose to share.

Well I feel like I learned lessons from genomes. A lot of this conversation
around genomes treats it like this mystical object, like it's a special type of
data, but the truth is there's a lot of data about ourselves that has these
properties. With genomes we have this ability to discover meaningful
information, and potentially re-identify.

<img style="float:right; max-width: 400px; width:50%; margin-left: 10px;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/bosc2017-slide-21.png">
The meaningful information that we usually think about first, as researchers in
biology, is that biological information &ndash; the traits, the medical effects,
the diseases. Some of it is innocuous in the sense that you're not going to
care if someone finds out you're a carrier for a recessive disease. I'm a
carrier for a recessive disease, for microcephaly. So, we all are. It's not a
big deal.

But there's other things that we would hesitate for others to know about. For
example, an ApoE4 allele &ndash; or, say you have two &ndash; those are more
unusual, but there's probably people in this room that have two E4 alleles, and
that greatly increases your risk of Alzheimer's disease. There's not much to be
done about it. And there's limits to what we can do to protect people from
genetic discrimination. You can pass a law that says you should not
discriminate, but if you're, say, the CEO of a publicly traded company&hellip;
you can't tell people not to sell their stock. So, there's limits to our
ability to protect people from the consequences of the information getting
out. So, it's valid to be worried.

<img style="float:right; max-width: 400px; width:50%; margin-left: 10px;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/bosc2017-slide-22.png">
The other thing that we often forget, that we find in genome data, is ancestry
information. And this is actually the most popular reason for people to go out
and get their genetic data. There's more, far more people getting AncestryDNA
than 23andMe. This is also a potential source for unexpected discoveries. So,
while ancestry can mean stuff like race and ethnicity predictions, it can also
mean discovering relatives &ndash; like 2nd or 3rd degree cousins &ndash; that
 you had lost track of. Or, perhaps, a half sibling you didn't know about, due
 to your father's affair some decades in the past.

So, a lot of the worries around genetic data have centered on the health
surprises. But some of the biggest bad stories have come around the family,
the ancestry surprises.

Finally, this ancestry information is what is rendering genomes highly
identifiable. It turns out that for many people, Y chromosomes and surnames
have been inherited in the same way &ndash; patrilineally &ndash; and there's
ancestry buffs who have created databases that correlate these two. And once
you have that, the cat's out of the bag, and you can start re-identifying
genomes. And that's exactly what was done.

<img style="float:right; max-width: 400px; width:50%; margin-left: 10px;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/bosc2017-slide-23.png">
Another reflection on what genomes have meant for us is the fact that cells
have genomes too. And we've been producing cell lines for decades. And it's
this phenomenon of discovering that you were disseminating data that you
thought was safe, and then you discover that it's not. And we're always going
to struggle with that fear, where we think we're going to disseminate, we think
something’s okay to share &ndash; but what if, what if.

There's not a lot of easy answers there, but maybe some lessons to look at.
There haven't actually been people sequencing the cell genomes and then
outing people based on them. So maybe humanity on the whole likes to behave
pretty well.

So, genomes have taught me broader lessons. I'm now going to introduce you to
another type of data that's kind of like genomes.

<img style="float:right; max-width: 400px; width:50%; margin-left: 10px;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/bosc2017-slide-25.png">
This is location data. This is a map of where I was over the course of two
years in New York City. So that's Manhattan on the left, Queens on the right.
Most people can be re-identified from location data because they spend most of
their time in two places: work and home. And it's very hard to scrub this data
to remove that identifying feature.

In addition I think you can imagine why people would consider location data to
be sensitive. They don't want people to know where they've been.

It's also very valuable for research. Where were you when you engaged in
certain behaviors? How do your walking habits in the city vary according to
weather or season?

So. One of the lessons from this might be that, for some data, only a few will
be "public". Not everyone is going to want to share their genome, and probably
even fewer want to share their location data.

<img style="float:right; max-width: 400px; width:50%; margin-left: 10px;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/bosc2017-slide-27.png">
So to get back to the PGP: how did the PGP do this in an ethical manner? How
did it choose to engage individuals to publicly share this data? Well, it
started out with a high bar: master's level or equivalent training in genetics.
And the first ten participants were recruited with an extensive engagement
with the ethics board, and interviews, they were all interviewed to make sure
they knew what they were getting into. Although nobody really knows what
you're getting into when you're doing stuff like this.

And after those ten people, the project developed an extensive consent process
with a quiz. And I've since learned a bit about consent. It's actually really
hard to do consent well, because it's just like terms of use, you just sign
it. You're not paying a lot of attention. You can try to make plain language,
but people are not paying attention. But that quiz that was added does have
an effect &ndash; and that's also come out in studies, if you add a quiz
suddenly people start understanding stuff &ndash; and you can see from this
analysis of the enrollment data, that a lot of people dropped out at that
quiz stage.

(This is an old analysis. There's now over 5500 people enrolled, over the
intervening years since I did this.)

<img style="float:right; max-width: 400px; width:50%; margin-left: 10px;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/bosc2017-slide-28.png">
So in conclusion, people are willing to share. But they like to be asked.

There's over 3500 people &ndash; this is my estimate &ndash; that have made
their genetic data, genotyping or genome data, public domain. If you recall
my numbers a little earlier, there wasn't that many PGP genomes. A lot of
these are genotyping data sets donated from direct to consumer companies like
23andMe. Many of them are from the PGP, but actually many more of them are
from the OpenSNP project. Bastian's right there.

<img style="float:right; max-width: 400px; width:50%; margin-left: 10px;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/bosc2017-slide-30.png">
So. A third observation on this is how the Personal Genome Project had this
sort of hubris of trying to study everything. And that this actually a bit
difficult to do.

These are some of the projects that I've worked with, that did work with
Personal Genome Project participants. Some of them to great success. In
the top left, the Genome in a Bottle consortium has genomes that are a
public reference standard in the United States, that could be used to
calibrate your sequencing device. And that's produced from PGP participants.

<img style="float:right; max-width: 400px; width:50%; margin-left: 10px;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/bosc2017-slide-31.png">
It's complicated though, to engage all of these different groups. One
observation here is that at some point, the Personal Genome Project is no
longer doing the research. It's engaging other studies to do the research.
And at some point the IRB starts getting confused. I praise the IRB, but
they're people. They're humans. And having the study coming back with a new
engagement plan each time was quite a burden on them, to ethically review
and understand what the heck was going on. And that could create some rather
dramatic frictions.

<img style="float:right; max-width: 400px; width:50%; margin-left: 10px;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/bosc2017-slide-32.png">
And yet, many do dream of comprehensive data. This is a United States program,
the Precision Medicine Initiative. It's impossible for me to talk to people in
the United States about PGP or Open Humans without having this come up.
Because there's these features, of wanting to collect data, of many different
sources, to do everything, to be data-driven and participant-engaged. Biology,
behavior, genetics, environment, data science, computation&hellip; it's just
everything, the more you can pack into it, the better. It's hard.

So from those lessons, I came out of it thinking how to improve the underlying
design of how this mechanism was working. Iterate and improve. And thinking
about a new way to be open about ourselves. Maybe a little bit less simple
than the model of making the data public domain.

<img style="float:right; max-width: 400px; width:50%; margin-left: 10px;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/bosc2017-slide-35.png">
And that is Open Humans. It is a nonprofit project. It has been supported by
funding from these three philanthropic organizations. And it's really trying
to provide something that all of us can benefit from.

So what is Open Humans trying to do? What is my idea on how to solve this problem?

Rather, if someone came up with another version of Open Humans that
did it better, then they'd be solving the same problem, but this is the
approach that I think works &ndash; or does things that are important.

And that is to center the data on the individuals.

And what do I mean by that?

<img style="float:right; max-width: 400px; width:50%; margin-left: 10px;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/bosc2017-slide-40.png">
Well, in our current model, the original data holders are the nearly universal
gatekeepers. That refers to diverse entities: the studies that produce data in
research, and organizations, but also corporations that have data about people.

So, as someone from the outside, looking in, you find yourself going to this
entity and asking them to share. One concern that is commonly brought up that
they cannot, that it would violate privacy. Or they want to be paid.

And then you might find yourself with another question. The data's not enough,
you need to ask maybe a simple survey question to get at the information that
you want, that you need to build on the data by engaging the individuals. And
if you ask to do that, usually the answer is going to be "No". The relationship
is controlled by that entity.

<img style="float:right; max-width: 400px; width:50%; margin-left: 10px;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/bosc2017-slide-42.png">
But asking the individuals is hard! You get out there, get on the sidewalk
with a sign, asking them to donate to you. Most of them are not going to hear
you. You can put your website up and ask for donations, ask people to share,
and you might get one person to come by and say "Okay".

Another person will say they don't have their data. That's an ongoing problem.
If you don't have your data &ndash; the entity has it, but you don't have it
&ndash; so you can't donate it. The entity's the only data holder. Then you
can't ask the individual for it.

<img style="float:right; max-width: 400px; width:50%; margin-left: 10px;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/bosc2017-slide-45.png">
What if people were in the same place? So it became easier to ask them? If you
said "please share" and they all heard you? And they said "okay"?

Except some of them might say "no thanks". Because now we're giving them the
power to decide, and this issue of privacy is now under their control, and they
can decide whether or not they want to share potentially identifiable and
sensitive data with you.
(There's still the people who don't have their data.)

<img style="float:right; max-width: 400px; width:50%; margin-left: 10px;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/bosc2017-slide-47.png">
What if many could ask? What if one person could get re-used by many different
projects? Data is not a zero sum game. It's actually trivial to hit a button
a couple different times and share it with all of those different entities.

<img style="float:right; max-width: 400px; width:50%; margin-left: 10px;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/bosc2017-slide-48.png">
What if it was easy to return data? And this is what I really hope we can be
doing more of. In the top left is something that's not happening yet, but I
hope you can see the potential now, if we were returning the data in a place,
in a platform, a community that gives people the opportunities to re-donate
it. That there's potential for new research that we're missing out on.

We also have the ability for people to create projects that just simply add
a data source. So, step away from this concept of only having studies &ndash;
but think about a citizen scientist who says: "Oh, I can help provide a data
source that researchers can use."

In fact one did. James Turner said: "Why don't have HealthKit data?" And I
said "We don't have an iOS developer." Because HealthKit data &ndash; it
measures your steps by the way, if you have an iPhone, your steps are
being measured &ndash; it's all being stored on the phone. It's not in the cloud.
That's how Apple is protecting its privacy, you need to install an app to get
it off. He writes an app to put the data into Open Humans. And a researcher
later used it, a master's student at ASU.

<img style="float:right; max-width: 400px; width:50%; margin-left: 10px;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/bosc2017-slide-49.png">
We can aggregate disparate data around people. So when you're talking about
getting data from a primary data holder, they just have their data. But when
you talk to the individual they can connect data from disparate sources. And
so now you can achieve that dream, of multi-faceted data. Of the genome, and
the health, the ancestry, activity tracking, GPS, maybe social media feeds.
It's really what you can imagine at this point.

And the person can offer to give it to you. And they can offer to do more with
you.

You can engage them and ask them to fill out a survey. The way Open Humans is
constructed, we are giving you the relationship with the individual, and not
merely the data. That relationship occurs via an anonymous identifier, so you
can actually conduct all of your research more securely by not receiving their
email address or their name. Maybe the data is potentially identifiable, but
for god's sake, if you have someone's email address attached to it, it's pretty
identifiable.

The ability to receive donations, and ask people to go answer surveys, or
otherwise engage with you &ndash; is a powerful thing. And that's something
that's lost when we talk about sharing the data through the central data holder.

<img style="float:right; max-width: 400px; width:50%; margin-left: 10px;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/bosc2017-slide-53.png">
Finally, we can share data across studies, over time. We can think of this as
a sort of "open cohort" that is shared between studies. So, one study that
returns data&hellip; means that another study may come along and say "Can
I see that data, and add to it, and build upon it?" And that data can be
shared&hellip; and of course that study can give information back. Put
the survey back. I don't know if you've engaged in research as a
participant, but the surveys can get kind of annoying over time. So maybe
if you put the survey data back, another study won't have to ask the same
questions again? One can hope, one can hope. I think that it's likely that
we'll still get lots of surveys.

<img style="float:right; max-width: 400px; width:50%; margin-left: 10px;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/bosc2017-slide-54.png">
But to get at the specs, since you're a programming crowd&hellip; I am also
a programmer. I manage the full stack of this website. The individual is
aggregating data, and it's sorted by data source. When they join a project
they're assigned a random identifier. They are granting permission to share
data that the project has requested, and they receive data if the project
chooses to return data &ndash; that's not required &ndash; neither is
required. They can send messages to the project, and they can withdraw at
any time. So they can hit a button and the project no longer has access to
their data. Now, can I force a project to delete data? That's going to be
down to the project's policies. Maybe some projects will say it's not
practical.

The project can request data, add data, send messages, send to surveys.
Importantly, this is all working immediately &ndash; this is all set up
and it works immediately -- there's APIs available. Do it all on the site,
or use OAuth2.

The site is open source.

I got asked this in my application. Is your software open source?
Well yes, it is.

But I could have built a website that asks for data donations, and put it
into a hole where nobody could get it. That's not the purpose, that's not
the type of open here. So the "open-sourciness" of this site is a little
bit beside the point, the "open-sourciness" of this project is about how
you can work with people and their data.

<img style="float:right; max-width: 400px; width:50%; margin-left: 10px;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/bosc2017-slide-55.png">
So here's some things, examples of projects, the activities that people can do.
They can bring in their data  from the Personal Genome Project, from 23andMe,
from Fitbit. They can also contribute it to studies, like Keeping Pace, which
is looking at GPS data. There's also some analysis tools, like the Genevieve
Genome Report, or James Turner also added Cross-Genome Error Check.

Now I'm going to revisit the idea of a public data model, and contrast
with this idea of sharing&hellip; the multi-faceted ability to share with
projects.

This is me trying to challenge someone in the audience that's already a
sharer. Bastian is already sharing his genetic data.

Bastian, would you be willing to share your location data? The continuous
location data passively tracked by your phone over the course of years?

Yeah? You would?

<img style="float:right; max-width: 400px; width:50%; margin-left: 10px;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/bosc2017-slide-57.png">
Well, what about this data source that I've been working on.

This is&hellip; Google Search data.

[laughter]

No?

There's always going to be some type of data that's just going to go a little
bit too far for you.

So this dream, that people are just going to open source themselves. That
they're just going to relax and let all of their data be seen by
everyone&hellip; we're going to be able to find something that you're not
going to want to share publicly.

So it's not always the solution. That's what I'm trying to get at.

Still a great solution. If I go back, you'll see there's a publicly share
button, in theory someone could publicly share this data. There are people
publicly sharing their location data. Only a very few.

So now I want to bring this to a concrete example. I've talked abstractly
about what could be done, what's possible. Well, this is a concrete example
of using this system, that's actually being done by a patient advocate and
citizen scientist and general all-around badass &ndash; and I think this is
how it's getting used first, because academics are a little slower, they want
to get a proposal together, and funding lined up, and then eventually&hellip;
maybe a year later&hellip; something will happen.

<img style="float:right; max-width: 400px; width:50%; margin-left: 10px;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/bosc2017-slide-60.png">
This is Dana Lewis. Does anyone in the audience know who Dana is? Well, Bastian
does because I talk about her. I'm so excited to talk about Dana to this crowd.

Dana comes from a community of open source developers that are type 1 diabetic
patients and their caregivers. And they have figured out how to get into their
data stream. There are devices that continuously monitor glucose data. And they
discovered ways to empower themselves with that. The Nightscout Project takes
that data, which is in the cloud -- the first step is to get the data into the
cloud -- and then Nightscout iterated on this to put in on a webserver so you
can remotely log in and look. And the Nightscout users are 90% parents who want
to be able to look at their child's glucose when they're not able to be there,
when they're in school.

Dana has type 1 diabetes, and she had a problem. She's a heavy sleeper.

I didn't know this before working with this community but type 1 diabetes
patients &ndash; are there any type 1 diabetes patients in the room?
Well type 1 diabetes patients have a 1 in 20 lifetime risk of dying in their
sleep. Due to hypoglycemic coma. So this device, it has an alarm that goes off
when your blood sugar getting low. But Dana's a heavy sleeper, and she was not
waking up with this alarm. And that's a very scary situation. Well, she has
access to the data. So Dana and Scott put together some software to get a
louder alarm.

All of this software is open source, this is a thriving, vibrant open source
community. It's patients helping each other, so there's people wandering in who
have no clue what to do, and others who are helping them to learn Heroku, to
set this up.

Once they'd done that, Dana and Scott realized that Dana's also wearing an
insulin pump, a basal insulin pump, that's operated via bluetooth. And they
thought, we can connect these. We can close the loop. We can build an algorithm
that goes from the glucose data, to adjust what the insulin is putting in, and
they did that. And formed the OpenAPS community. One of the things I love about
Dana is that she's really pushing this. This is now in the realm of medical
device territory. That's her code on her shirt, on the left there. She's in
the US, and she's using the fact that this is free speech to defend her right
to share the source code.

<img style="float:right; max-width: 400px; width:50%; margin-left: 10px;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/bosc2017-slide-62.png">
Well, the opportunity here is that the glucose data is being collected, and how
can we collect this to use it for research? How can we aggregate it, how can we
manage data sharing and enable community research?

The solution is to use Open Humans.

<img style="float:right; max-width: 400px; width:50%; margin-left: 10px;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/bosc2017-slide-66.png">
And the problem is that data is being collected on an individual scale. And so,
Open Humans becomes a solution because we can use a project &ndash; as a data
source &ndash; to copy that data into an Open Humans account. From there, an
individual can donate it to various projects, including one that Dana is
running: the OpenAPS Data Commons. There's also a Nightscout Data Commons that
we're hoping to launch soon, and there's the potential for various other
projects that are both academic and citizen-led.

Dana's data commons demonstrates a sort of middle tier in which data donation
can occur, that's not public, but is granting multiple uses. And Dana has
brought this data to researchers at Stanford and at Johns Hopkins, and they've
started analyzing it. And it's the type of data where you only need like 20
people to establish significance, because it's such a dramatic sort of thing.

So as I close, as I get near the end, I want to say something about why I'm
here.

<img style="float:right; max-width: 400px; width:50%; margin-left: 10px;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/bosc2017-slide-69.png">
I want to invite everyone to help build this. This is a type of community and
platform that can only exist when people buy in together and decide to make
projects on it, because each project feeds forward and helps other projects
to exist. To that end, I'm putting forward grants of up to $5000 for projects
on the site that will help. And so if you have any idea of something cool to
do with this data, that would help grow this ecosystem, or if you know anyone
who might be interested &ndash; maybe on like the grad student level, because
this is not a huge amount of money, it's Google Summer of Code money &ndash;
then by all means share this with them. I also have need for a developer, so
if you go to the bottom of the website, you'll see a jobs posting&hellip;

But another thing I want to tell you is that I want your feedback. Tell me
what's not so great, or what could be improved. I'm really genuine in my
desire for this potential solution to be something that others buy in and
have feedback on. To that end, there's a chatroom, I want to invite you to
give feedback &ndash; I'm sharing the chatroom with you because you could give
me private feedback and I could ignore it, right, and nobody would know. But
here's a chatroom where you can tell me, and tell everybody else, and if you
think I'm doing something wrong, everybody's going to know. I'm exposing
myself here to the community talking to each other, and giving me feedback
on how they should operate &ndash; we should operate &ndash; this should be
something that's ours.

So what does open mean. This is a closing remark as I back out, when I think
about "what does open mean to us".

<img style="float:right; max-width: 400px; width:50%; margin-left: 10px;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/bosc2017-slide-71.png">
A lot of times when we approach the concept of open, we think in terms of
quality and efficiency. So we're thinking about making science more
reproducible. Or we're thinking about not re-inventing the wheel, on
re-using work that others have made. And this is a great type of open.
This is much more fundable.

<img style="float:right; max-width: 400px; width:50%; margin-left: 10px;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/bosc2017-slide-72.png">
But another type of open, that kind of hearkens to the roots of open source
&ndash; to the experience of Stallman as he was frustrated with his printer,
and wanted to fix it, and he wanted the source code to that &ndash; is the
type of open about access, and empowerment, and growth.

Because when we enable people to do new things that weren't previously possible,
more people to do things that they previously couldn't have done, then we
can see things happen that wouldn't have happened before. And this is harder
to predict, but I think really beautiful. And so we can hope for data sharing
that would not have otherwise happened. We can hope for types of research that
were not previously possible.

<img style="float:right; max-width: 400px; width:50%; margin-left: 10px;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/bosc2017-slide-73.png">
So. Last slide. I want to thank the participants in the Personal Genome
Project and the members of the Open Humans community. Open Humans is not a
study in itself, I think an IRB would choke on that. It's a nexus point, a
matchmaker. And up there in top left, some contact information for me, and
that chatroom again. And I think with that, I'll open it up for questions.
