  <img class="about-page-img" src="/images/madpriceball-photo.jpg">

  <p>
    I am Executive Director and President of
    <a href="http://openhumansfoundation.org">Open Humans Foundation</a>
    and co-founder of <a href="https://www.openhumans.org">Open Humans</a>.
    My work is funded by a
    <a href="https://shuttleworthfoundation.org/fellows/mad-ball/">Shuttleworth
    Foundation Fellowship</a>,
    which supports my vision for applying "open" principles to change how we
    share and study health and personal data.
  </p>

  <p>
    I combine advocacy and technology to explore new,
    participant-centered approaches for health and personal data sharing,
    research, and citizen science. My work is multifaceted: I collaborate
    with diverse research teams and citizen scientists, perform outreach through
    writing and speaking, and oversee Open Humans technical development and
    operations.

  <h2>About Open Humans</h2>

  <img class="about-page-img" src="/images/open-humans-logo.png">

  <p>
    <a href="https://www.openhumans.org/">Open Humans</a>
    is a nonprofit project that combines technology and
    community to advance an open and participant-centric
    approach to human subjects research. By working with
    the individuals who are contributing to research,
    we can enable new ways to share data and new
    approaches to doing science.
  </p>

  <p>
    Open Humans is a program of the
    <a href="http://openhumansfoundation.org">Open Humans Foundation</a>,
    a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to making a
    wide spectrum of data about humans accessible to increase
    biological literacy and improve human health.
  </p>

  <p>
    Open Humans enables diverse new approaches to research and more,
    including:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>An "open cohort" approach</b><br>
      where individuals join multiple studies, and can share
      data between them.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Giving data to participants</b><br>
      so they can explore their own data &ndash; and
      choose when to share with others.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>External data sources</b><br>
      enabling volunteers to initiate new data streams.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Citizen-led projects</b><br> that work with members
      and their data, e.g. data commons, data exploration,
      and citizen science.
    </li>
  </ul>
