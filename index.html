  <img class="about-page-img" src="/images/madpriceball-photo.jpg">

  <p>
    I am Executive Director and President of
    <a href="http://openhumansfoundation.org">Open Humans Foundation</a>
    and co-founder of <a href="https://www.openhumans.org">Open Humans</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    My work focuses on enabling people to access, use, and share their
    health and personal data toadvance individual understanding, collective
    empowerment, and research. This work primarily occurs through Open Humans
    and the associated nonprofit, Open Humans Foundation. Open Humans combines
    technology and community to advance an open and participant-centric
    approach to human subjects research. By working with the individuals
    who are contributing toresearch, we can enable new ways to share data
    and new approaches to doing science. My work also extends to related areas
    in N-of-1 and participant-led research, open science, and advocacy.
