## About me

<div class="about-page-img" markdown="1">
  ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/madeleine-ball-photo.jpg)
</div>

I am a [Shuttleworth Fellow](https://shuttleworthfoundation.org/fellows/),
dedicated to applying "open" principles to change how we share and study
human health data. I combine advocacy and technology to explore new,
participant-centered approaches for health data sharing, research, and
citizen science. My work primarily occurs through
[Open Humans](https://www.openhumans.org), a project I co-founded.

As part my fellowship, I am also independently funded.
I retain an unpaid role as Director of Research of
[Open Humans Foundation](http://openhumansfoundation.org), and am
on the Board of Directors.

My work is multifaceted: I collaborate with diverse research
teams and citizen scientists, perform outreach through
writing and speaking, and continue to lead Open Humans
technical development and operations.

Within Open&nbsp;Humans, I am also Principal Investigator of our
[Public Data Sharing study](https://www.openhumans.org/public-data/).
In addition, I continue to serve as Director of Research for the
[Harvard Personal Genome Project](http://www.personalgenomes.org/harvard)
and advise other research studies and projects.

[Open Humans](https://www.openhumans.org/)
is a nonprofit project that combines technology and
community to advance an open and participant-centric
approach to human subjects research. By working with
the individuals who are contributing to research,
we can enable new ways to share data and new
approaches to doing science.

Open Humans is a program of the
[Open Humans Foundation](http://openhumansfoundation.org),
a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to making a
wide spectrum of data about humans accessible to increase
biological literacy and improve human health.

Open Humans enables diverse new approaches to research,
including:

* **An "open cohort" approach**<br>
  where individuals join multiple studies, and can share
  data between them.
* **Giving data to participants**<br>
  so they can explore their own data &ndash; and
  choose when to share with others.
* **External data sources**<br>
  enabling volunteers to initiate new data streams.
* **Citizen-led projects**<br> that work with members
  and their data, e.g. data commons, data exploration,
  and citizen science.
