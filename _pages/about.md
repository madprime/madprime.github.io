## About me

<div class="about-page-img" markdown="1">
  ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/madpriceball-photo.jpg)
</div>

I am Executive Director of [Open Humans Foundation](http://openhumansfoundation.org)
and co-founder of [Open Humans](https://www.openhumans.org). My work is funded
by a [Shuttleworth Foundation Fellowship](https://shuttleworthfoundation.org/fellows/mad-ball/),
which supports my vision for applying "open" principles to change how we share
and study human health data.

I combine advocacy and technology to explore new,
participant-centered approaches for health data sharing, research, and
citizen science. My work is multifaceted: I collaborate with diverse research
teams and citizen scientists, perform outreach through
writing and speaking, and oversee Open Humans technical development and
operations.

## About Open Humans

[Open Humans](https://www.openhumans.org/)
is a nonprofit project that combines technology and
community to advance an open and participant-centric
approach to human subjects research. By working with
the individuals who are contributing to research,
we can enable new ways to share data and new
approaches to doing science.

Open Humans is a program of the
[Open Humans Foundation](http://openhumansfoundation.org),
a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to making a
wide spectrum of data about humans accessible to increase
biological literacy and improve human health.

Open Humans enables diverse new approaches to research,
including:

* **An "open cohort" approach**<br>
  where individuals join multiple studies, and can share
  data between them.
* **Giving data to participants**<br>
  so they can explore their own data &ndash; and
  choose when to share with others.
* **External data sources**<br>
  enabling volunteers to initiate new data streams.
* **Citizen-led projects**<br> that work with members
  and their data, e.g. data commons, data exploration,
  and citizen science.
