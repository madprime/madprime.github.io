In general I prefer to be contacted publicly rather than privately.

## In a chatroom
If you have questions related Open Humans, I'd like to encourage you to join
the Open Humans Community Slack group.

Use this to get an immediate invite:

## On Twitter
You can also contact me on Twitter at: [@madprime](https://www.twitter.com/madprime/)

## By email
If you prefer to be private, you can reach me at my Open Humans
email, which combines my first name with the openhumans.org domain.

## For secrets
Finally &ndash; and at the other extreme &ndash; my Keybase account can be
used for encrypted correspondence and file-sharing:
